	\textbf{L}ogical \textbf{V}olume \textbf{M}anagement (LVM) makes it easier to manage disk space. 
\bigskip

\paragraph{Problem with normal partition:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Once a partition is created, it cannot be resized. 
		\item If a partition needs to be reduced or expanded, it's not possible.	
	\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\paragraph{LVM is used for the following purposes:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Combine multiple HDD storage and use them as single HDD.
	\item If existing partition size is 100\% full, you can extend it without the need to unmount the partition.
	\item If existing partition size is very large and resulting in space wasteage, you can reduce it without the need to unmount the partition.
\end{itemize}
